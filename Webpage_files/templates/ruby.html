          Supervised Machine Learning: Predicting Body Type & Gender
        </h1>
        <hr>
      
        <p>To utilize Machine Learning in this aspect, I started by cleaning my provided CSV file and
          whittling down specific datasets that would contribute to body type and gender. 
        </p>
        <br class ="blank">
  
        <div class = "container"> 
          <img class="col-md-6 float-md-start fit-image" src="../static/images/csv_table.png" align = "center">
        </div>
        <br class ="blank">
        <p>
          Cleaning it a bit further to prevent any NaN values, character errors, etc, I proceeded to
          separate the data into data & target. Body Type was what we were trying to get, so that will be the first
          target data. I used get_dummies on our data to convert our string values into int, and used labelencoder for 
          our target, since we had six possible outcome for it. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I then split the data up into training & testing data and plugged it into the random forest model.
          <br>
          <br>
          The outcome was surprising. With the Training Score at 75% and the Testing Score at 40%, I was unsure if
          this was because of the data or if it was because of the model. Testing out the Neural Network Model with 50 epochs,
          the score plateau'd at 3 epochs in, giving the score of 14% accuracy. It was obvious that this data was not compatible
          with our models.
          <br>
          <br>
          When we switched gears, trying to predict gender instead of body types, the same models (in addition with Logistic Regression)
          turned out to be much better. With the RandomForest model, I get the percentage of 94% for training and 82% for testing. Much better
          than when we were targeting body type. Logistic Regression gives 84% for training and 85% for testing. For Neural Network, 
          we end with an accuracy of 85% with 50 epochs. 
          <br>
          <br>
          With our target data being Sex, we managed to have a higher accuracy score for all three models.
          It's interesting since this having less target values to predict might be better, in correlation with the data we have.
          With having more target values, in this case the body types, the models we selected did poorly regarding predicting
          the correct body types. In the future, we might test with more models to see if the there are any that are more
          compatible with our data, or if we can clean this to be more concise so we can introduce more variables that may help
          with future predictions.
